# Cross_Tensor_Completion

This is a reposity for tensor completion using cross tensor approximation algorithms. To run the codes, you need some functions of the following toolboxes 

https://github.com/canyilu/Tensor-tensor-product-toolbox

https://www.tensortoolbox.org/

https://www.tensorlab.net/

We may need the codes from the following repositories for comparing the results of cross algorithms with the other completion algorithms
